You are provided arrays A and B, and values M, X and Y:
    A contains the list of the weight of N people waiting to use the elevator.
    B contains the floors each of the N people need to visit.
    You are also given:
        M (number of floors in the building),
        X (maximum capacity of lift),
        Y (maximum weight limit on lift)

    Given that people must be served in the order they arrive,
    Write a function to calculate the number of floors the lift must stop at and come back
    to the ground floor in order to service all of the people.

    eg. A = [40, 40, 100, 60], B = [3, 3, 2, 2], M = 3, X = 3, Y = 200
    1) Lift will take person 1, 2, 3 to floor 3 and floor 2 => 2 floors
    2) Lift will return to ground floor => 1 floor
    3) Lift will take person 4 to floor 2 => 1 floor
    4) Lift will return to ground floor => 1 floor
    Total floors = 5

Your answer must be within:
    Worst time complexity = O(N)
    Auxillary space complexity = O(N)

Please provide your answer below
